    "about-question-2": "What is a Citizen Science project?",
    "about-answer-2": "In Citizen Science projects, volunteer contributors (“citizens”) and scientists work together to produce scientific knowledge. Projects may take many different forms, from classifying images of snakes to transcribing handwritten German dialect, from collecting samples of water to taking pictures of insects and plants. If you want to learn more about Citizen Science (including an extensive list of existing projects) {link1} is a good starting point. ",
    "about-question-3": "Which kind of projects can be created in the CS Project Builder?",
    "about-answer-3": "In its initial version, the CS Project Builder allows users to perform complex data classification tasks. It supports projects where contributors can analyze or enrich existing data, typically large sets of images or texts (ie. satellite pictures, social media posts, etc.), as well as other media formats such as videos, audios, and scanned documents. Next step, the web-based tool will be integrated with a data collection (smartphone-based) tool. .",
    "about-question-4": "What is the aim of the CS Project Builder?",
    "about-answer-4": "The CS Project Builder facilitates the implementation of CS projects by providing an interface that requires limited technical knowledge, and ideally little or no coding skills. Its aim is to facilitate the co-creation of Citizen Science projects by starting with the implementation of simple pilots.",
    "about-answer-5": "Anybody with an idea for a data classification project can implement it here, as long as it complies with the platform criteria {criteria}. Next step is to build around it an initial community of contributors (colleagues, friends, family, and more!) that will allow to test its scope, form, and potentials. By involving all contributors in the co-creation process, a lot can be learned about research questions, process, data, and mutual benefits, before deciding to spend more resources in a full-fledged implementation (ie. developing a project with a unique graphic style, dedicated features, etc. For more info on this option, please contact us).",
    "about-question-6": "A bit of history ...",
    "about-answer-6": "The web interface for the CS Project Builder is inspired by the now discontinued Crowdcrafting platform. Its implementation is based on the open source crowdsourcing framework {pybossa}. The code is publicly available under the ‘CitizenScienceCenter’ organisation on {csgit}.",

    "about-criteria-label1": "Anybody can create a project in the platform, as long it obeys to the following criteria:",

    "about-criteria-list2": "The project objectives and desired outcomes are communicated in the project description in an accessible and comprehensible manner. ",
    "about-criteria-list3": "The objectives of the project are impossible – or very hard - to achieve without the contribution of the citizens.",
    "about-criteria-list4": "The project is open for all volunteer contributors to participate.",
    "about-criteria-list5": "An easy way to communicate with the project organizer is available for feedback and discussions.",
    "about-criteria-list6": "The content of the project does not facilitate illegal acts and does not cause offense to any audience (see terms and conditions for details). ",
    "about-criteria-list7": "The project’s goals (quantity of necessary data, coverage, required number of participants) are reasonable and achievable within a defined timeframe.",
    "about-criteria-list8": "Ethical aspects are considered (e.g. diversity, inclusion, gender equality) and permission of the UZH/ETH Ethical Commission is previously requested and obtained when necessary. ",
    "about-criteria-list9": "Data generated by the project follows the EC principle 'as open as possible, as closed as necessary', which focuses encouraging as few restrictions as possible, while at the same time protecting sensitive data from inappropriate access.",
    "about-criteria-list10": "The results of the project are published in an open-access format, provided there are no legitimate, legal, or ethical arguments against doing so. "

    "about-question-2": "Was ist ein Citizen Science Projekt?",
    "about-answer-2": "Bei Citizen Science Projekten arbeiten freiwillige Mitwirkende («Bürger» oder «Bürgerinnen») und Forschende zusammen, um Wissen zu generieren. Viele verschiedene Projektformen sind möglich – von der Klassifizierung von Schlangenbildern über die Transkription handschriftlicher deutscher Dialekte bis hin zum Sammeln von Wasserproben und Fotodokumentationen über Insekten und Pflanzen. Wenn Sie mehr über Citizen Science erfahren möchten, finden Sie bei {link1} auf hilfreiche Informationen (einschliesslich einer umfassenden Liste bereits existierender Projekte).",
    "about-question-3": "Welche Projekte können mit dem CS Project Builder entwickelt werden?",
    "about-answer-3": "Die Erstversion des CS Project Builder ermöglicht den Personen, die ihn nutzen, die Durchführung komplexer Datenklassifizierungen. Sie unterstützt Projekte, bei denen bereits existierende Daten von Mitwirkenden analysiert oder angereichert werden können – typischerweise grosse Bild- oder Textmengen (z. B. Satellitenfotos, Social-Media-Beiträge etc.), aber auch andere Medienformate wie Video- und Audioaufzeichnungen und gescannte Unterlagen. Im nächsten Schritt wird in das webbasierte Tool ein Tool zur Datenerfassung (Smartphone-basiert) integriert.",
    "about-question-4": "Was ist der Zweck des CS Project Builder?",
    "about-answer-4": "Der CS Project Builder erleichtert die Durchführung von CS Projekten, indem er eine Benutzeroberfläche bietet, die keine speziellen technischen Kenntnisse und bestenfalls nur wenig oder gar keine Programmierkenntnisse erfordert. Er soll die gemeinsame Entwicklung – die «Co-Creation» – von Citizen Science Projekten erleichtern, wobei mit der Durchführung einfacher Pilotprojekte begonnen wird.",
    "about-answer-5": "Alle, die eine Idee für ein Datenklassifizierungsprojekt haben, können ihr Projekt hier planen, solange es die Plattformkriterien erfüllt. Im nächsten Schritt bauen Sie eine Teilnehmer-Community für das Projekt auf (Kolleginnen, Freunde, Familienmitglieder und auch andere), mit deren Hilfe sich Umfang, Form und Potenzial des Projekts austesten lassen. Durch Einbindung aller Mitwirkenden in den Co-Creation-Prozess können wertvolle Informationen über Forschungsfragen, Prozesse, Daten und gegenseitigen Nutzen gewonnen werden, bevor man sich entschliesst, noch mehr Mittel in die Ausgestaltung zu investieren (d. h. bevor man ein Projekt mit eigenem graphischen Konzept entwickelt, spezifische Charakteristika erarbeitet etc. Bitte kontaktieren Sie uns, wenn Sie weitere Informationen zu dieser Option wünschen.)",

    "about-answer-6": "Als Vorbild für das Webinterface des CS Project Builder diente die inzwischen eingestellte Crowdcrafting platform.
